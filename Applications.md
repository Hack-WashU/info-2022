# Applications FAQ

## Why do we require a resume?

Hack WashU is a sponsored event. The benefit of sponsoring our event is access to top-notch students who are capable of doing great things.
This access takes the form of both the chance to interact with students during the event, and also a copy of all of our Hackers' resumes afterwards.

Don't have a resume? Reach out to the [career center](https://students.wustl.edu/career-center/)! They're great at what they do.

## Why is this a hybrid event?

Trust us, we *really* wanted to be in-person this year. We needed to decide on an event format in April 2022, and at the time WashU wasn't able to tell us whether or not we would be able to host hackers from outside of the university.
Similarly, we don't have the funding necessary to cover travel/accommodation for everyone outside of STL. Much of the money we raised from sponsorships this year is being put towards that exact cause for future events. 

## I'm a WashU student. Can I guaruntee my admission to the event?

Our plan is to admit all WashU students who apply, though this depends on how many of you do so :) .
