# Applications FAQ

## Why do we require a resume?

Hack WashU is a sponsored event. The benefit of sponsoring our event is access to top-notch students who are capable of doing great things.
This access takes the form of both the chance to interact with students during the event, and also a copy of all of our Hackers' resumes afterwards.
